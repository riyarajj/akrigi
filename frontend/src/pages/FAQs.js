                    <h6><b>What types of items do you sell?</b></h6>
                    <ul><li>Currently we sell all kinds of Clothing, Footwear, accessories and essentials. Please click here to see an extensive list of items we offer.</li></ul>
                    <h6><b>How do I know the items you sell are safe?</b></h6>
                    <ul><li>We make every effort to ensure everything we sell is good quality and in working order. However, even we may miss something, so when in doubt, connect with us to ask questions.</li></ul>
                    <h6><b>Have the clothes been washed?</b></h6>
                    <ul><li>The items come to us from donations. So, we make a point to segregate the clean ones, disinfect them and then put on sale. However, we request you to water- wash them once purchased.</li></ul>
                    <h6><b>Do you sanitize your merchandise?</b></h6>
                    <ul><li>Our research has shown us that most donors truly want to give items that can be re-used or re-sold. Over 60% of our donations are actually handed directly to one of our Attendants during a free home pickup. In these cases (face to face), donors don’t typically give items in poor condition. While we don’t wash received donations, we are very careful to separate items that are not in re-sale condition. We also refresh our merchandise by spraying it with a non-allergenic industrial strength deodorizer and disinfect or sanitize them before packing.</li></ul>
                    <ul><li>As a precautionary measure, customers may want to wash or sanitize items before putting them to use.Can you change the price if I think it is too high?</li></ul>
                    <h6><b>Can you change the price if I think it is too high?</b></h6>
                    <ul><li>We know price is an important factor when it comes to purchasing and we strive to provide the lowest prices possible, while ensuring Akrigi is able to give generously to the local charity it directly supports. If you ever have a question about a price, please connect with us.</li></ul>
